I usually have a split terminal below my code, in which I might run various commands
which print a filename:[line]:[column]. This plugin maps `gf` to open the file at that
position, but in the split above.

See also https://github.com/felipec/vim-sanegx for a similar fix for gf,
opening URLs in the browser.
